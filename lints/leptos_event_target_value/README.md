# leptos_event_target_value

### What it does

Warn about usages of `event_target_value`. The purpose of this lint is
to make users know that the function may panic under certain circumstances.

### Why is this bad?

The function `leptos::prelude::event_target_value` will panic at run-time
if the event doesn't have a target (eg. `web_sys::FetchEvent`), is manually
created with `web_sys::Event::new` or `web_sys::MouseEvent::new`, or
the target doesn't have a `value()` method. This can introduce hard-to-debug
runtime errors in Leptos applications that produce panics at run-time.

To reproduce:

```rust,ignore
let event = web_sys::Event::new("visibilitychange").unwrap();
let target = leptos::prelude::event_target::<web_sys::Document>(&event);
```

In case that the event's target doesn't have a `value()` method, calling
`event_target_value` will display somehing like:

```ignore
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')
```

The underlying problem is that the MDN APIs don't guarantee at type level
the element returned by `target`.

### Example

```rust,ignore
let target = leptos::prelude::event_target_value::<web_sys::Document>(&event);
```

Use instead:

```rust,ignore
let value = match event.target() {
    Some(t) => match t.dyn_into::<web_sys::HtmlInputElement>() {
        Ok(input) => Some(input.value()),
        Err(_) => {
            // handle the case where the target doesn't have a value
           todo!()
        },
    },
    None => {
       // handle the case where there is no target
       todo!()
    },
};
```

Or allow the lint if you're sure that the event has a target and the target
has a `value()` method:

```rust,ignore
#[allow(leptos_event_target_value)]
let value = leptos::prelude::event_target_value::<web_sys::Document>(&event);
```
