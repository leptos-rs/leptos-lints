# leptos_unscoped_spawn

### What it does

Forbids the use of `leptos::task::spawn_local`, and recommends using
`leptos::task::spawn_local_scoped` instead.  The purpose of this lint is
to reduce the risk of missing context at run-time.

### Why is this bad?

In Leptos, it's not always obvious when contexts are available. There are situations
where they are not, like in unscoped spawns. These missing contexts can be difficult
to detect and debug, and lead to run-time bugs.

For a in-depth explanation, please refer to [`leptos_unscoped_spawn`'s rationale].

[`leptos_unscoped_spawn`'s rationale]: https://github.com/leptos-rs/leptos-lints/blob/main/lints/leptos_unscoped_spawn/RATIONALE.md

### Example

```rust
leptos::task::spawn_local(async {
    // ...
});
```

Use instead:

```rust
leptos::task::spawn_local_scoped(async {
    // ...
});
```

A scoped spawn is less performant, so if you're sure that you're not using contexts
in the spawn, allow the spawn to be unscoped.

```rust
#[allow(leptos_unscoped_spawn)]
leptos::task::spawn_local(async {
    // ...
});
```
